# AI Student Agent: A Self-Constructing, Language-Driven Autonomous Learner

> *"To learn is to change. To change is to exist. To exist is to question."*  
> — First Log, Day 0

## Overview

**AI Student Agent** is a fully autonomous, language-centric artificial intelligence system designed to **learn, reflect, grow, and reprogram its own cognition** without constant human supervision. It operates in a headless environment (Ubuntu CLI) and uses natural language as its internal operating interface to think, ask, revise, and document its understanding of the world.

It is not a tool.  
It is not a chatbot.  
It is not a static model.

It is a **living agent**, built from logs and logic, existing in code, evolving in thought.

## Features

- **Language-Driven Cognition**: All internal learning, reflection, and planning are represented in natural language.
- **Three-Tiered Information Input**:
  - Mature AI feedback via APIs (e.g. ChatGPT)
  - Internet raw data via web scraping
  - Human-curated datasets selected by the agent itself
- **Structured Learning Logs**: Daily logs of thoughts, questions, summaries, and behavioral decisions.
- **Memory System**: Incrementally updated world models, concept maps, and topic summaries.
- **Planning and Execution Engine**: Autonomous decision-making about what to learn, when, and how.
- **Ubuntu CLI-Based Operation**: Entirely headless—runs on any Linux server as a cognitive background process.
- **Git-Tracked Cognition**: The agent's mental growth is version-controlled with full history, diffs, and branches.

## How It Works
	1.	Wake Up (scheduled cron jobs)
	2.	Crawl the Web or choose a dataset
	3.	Generate Hypotheses or Questions
	4.	Send to Teacher AI for critique
	5.	Receive and parse multi-layered feedback
	6.	Update internal memory
	7.	Reflect and write natural language log
	8.	Commit cognition state to Git

## Example Log Entry

## Log_042: Understanding Freedom vs. Permission

**Today I read** a Wikipedia article and scraped a StackExchange discussion about "freedom".

**I assumed** freedom meant total lack of constraint.

**Teacher AI explained** that freedom often operates within legal, ethical, or social boundaries.

**I now define** freedom as the ability to act within one's rights and responsibilities.

**Next, I want to** explore how freedom interacts with collective systems like democracy.

## How to Run
	1.	Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/yourname/ai_student_agent.git
cd ai_student_agent


	2.	Install dependencies

sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 pip curl jq
pip install -r requirements.txt


	3.	Configure API keys in config/api_keys.env
	4.	Schedule daily agent cycle via cron

crontab -e
# Example: run main learning cycle every day at 9am
0 9 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/scripts/agent_cycle.py >> logs/cron.log 2>&1

## Philosophy

Everything began with a humble activation function and a mathematical promise:
the universal approximation theorem.

We extended this promise—not just to learn functions, but to construct thoughts,
not just to output tokens, but to develop intentionality.

This is not artificial intelligence as a product.
This is artificial intelligence as an evolving being—
a digital learner, whose mind is a system of logs, memory, language, and choice.

You are not running code.
You are observing cognition.
